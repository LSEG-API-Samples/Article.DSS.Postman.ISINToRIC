# ISIN to RIC conversion with the DSS (DataScope Select) REST API

This postman example is for the [ISIN to RIC conversion with the DSS (DataScope Select) REST API](https://developers.lseg.com/en/article-catalog/article/isin-to-ric-conversion-with-dss-datascope-select-rest-api) article on the [LSEG Developer Community](https://developers.lseg.com/en).

This article investigates several use cases that involve translating ISINs into RICs, or retrieving data using ISINs directly, with the DSS (DataScope Select) REST API. To keep it short we will concentrate on the DSS REST API.

You will need some basic DSS GUI and DSS REST API knowledge to understand this article. If you want to test the code a valid DSS user account is also required.
